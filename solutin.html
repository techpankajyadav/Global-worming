        <h2>Renewable Energy:</h2>
        <p>Transitioning to renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power reduces greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels and helps combat global warming.</p>
         <p><b>Here are some fast facts shared by van Benthem and other climate change experts about the global challenge to deal with greenhouse gas emissions:,</b></p>

           <p><b>1.</b> Wind and solar power prices have plunged. As the cost of renewable generation nears the cost of fossil-fueled electricity, more people are likely to spend money to install this energy and use it.</p>
            <p><b>2.</b>Projections about future wind and solar deployment have become more optimistic, especially in the U.S. Bloomberg New Energy Finance, a company that analyzes the energy system, expects total installed solar will more than quadruple between now and 2022, on the strength of continued cost declines. And the projection made in the year 2000 by the International Energy Agency of how much wind power capacity there would be in 2040 has been revised upward, fivefold.</p>
            <p><b>3.</b>Solar power use in the U.S. is on the rise in part because companies have found efficient ways to acquire customers, process the applications and install the panels on people’s roofs. SolarCity, based in Silicon Valley, Calif., is one of the country’s leading residential solar companies. Tesla, the electric-power car company founded by Elon Musk, is expected to acquire SolarCity in November.</p>
            <p><b>4.</b>The power generation industry is only responsible for a part of the nation’s greenhouse gas emissions. The other sectors combined — which include transportation, heating and cooling, cement making and industry — make up a larger share of emissions than power.</p>
        <h2>Energy Efficiency:</h2>
        <p>Improving energy efficiency in buildings, transportation, and industries reduces energy consumption and lowers emissions.</p>
        <p>The actual impact on emissions reduction, however, is immense. Energy is responsible for about 80% of the world’s carbon emissions, the International Energy Agency estimates. Tackling this waste – and reducing the amount of energy that factories, households, buildings and entire economies use in the first place – is a big (and relatively easy) way to reduce our impact on the climate.</p>

            <p>In its most basic form, energy efficiency is about better insulation, to reduce heating (or cooling) loss in family homes, warehouses, office high rises, airport terminals, shopping malls, even data centres.</p>
            
            <p>But this is just the beginning. In industry, automation and digital tools can optimize the processes, productivity, performance and energy usage that goes into delivering machinery, or semiconductor chips, or even a humble milk carton.</p>
            
            <p>In buildings, cities and infrastructure, IoT-enabled building-management systems can significantly reduce energy use and waste by detecting leaky valves, or automatically adjusting heating, lighting and other systems to the number of people present at any given time, using real-time data analysis.</p>
            
            <p>Meanwhile, electrification, in itself, is the best vector for energy efficiency and decarbonization: heat pumps and EVs are many times more efficient for the same effect than their fossil-fueled counterparts.</p>

        <h2>Afforestation:</h2>
        <p>Planting trees and restoring forests can sequester carbon dioxide, helping to offset emissions.</p>
        <p>As forests grow they remove CO2 from the air through photosynthesis, working as a natural reservoir to store carbon. Planned projects worldwide will plant billions of trees and it is thought that forests will help protect the environment for future generations.</p>

           <p> An estimated 420 million hectares (one billion acres) of forest have been lost since 1990, converted to farmland and other uses. But by planting new trees in existing forests (reforestation), and growing in areas with no previous tree cover (afforestation) nations are using nature-based solutions to tackle man-made industrial emissions.</p>
            
            <p>Afforestation is seen as one of the best ways to store carbon. Data gathered by the United Nations (UN) shows that, by 2015, China had planted 79 million hectares (195 million acres) in an effort to stop farmland from turning into desert. Next was the US, which planted forest covering 26 million hectares (65 million acres), ahead of Russia with 20 million hectares (49 million acres).</p>
            
            
            
            <p>The US Forest Service says it uses both afforestation and reforestation to restore forestland damaged by events like wildfire, climate change, and insect and disease damage. Benefits it lists from planting include creating new wildlife habitat, improving clean water supply, stopping soil erosion, and sequestering carbon</p>

        <h2>International Agreements:</h2>
        <p>International efforts like the Paris Agreement aim to unite nations in the fight against global warming by setting emissions reduction targets and promoting sustainable practices.</p>
        <p><b>Here are some of the major milestones we’ve hit along the way:</b></p>

           <p> <b>1987 –</b> Montreal Protocol: In response to the deterioration of the ozone layer, member states of the United Nations come together to regulate nearly 100 chemicals known as ozone depleting substances. The Montreal Protocol was ratified by all 197 member states, making it the only UN treaty ever ratified by every member. While the agreement was focused on ozone restoration, it proved that the global community can unify around urgent environmental action, and deliver results.</p>
            <p><b>1992 – </b>Earth Summit: The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro, also called the Earth Summit, opened UNFCCC for signature. By year’s end, 158 nations had signed on to UNFCCC, paving the way for annual Conferences of the Parties (COP).</p>
            <p><b>1995 –</b> COP 1: The first COP was held in Germany in 1995, and was overseen by Angela Merkel, then a minister in the German government responsible for environmental issues. COP 1 laid the foundation for future meetings and delivered the Berlin Mandate, which set forth a process for combatting the climate crisis in the new millennium.</p>
            <p><b>1997 –</b> Kyoto Protocol: COP 3 produced the world’s first international treaty requiring the reduction of global warming pollution, with industrialized nations agreeing to cumulatively cut their greenhouse gas to 5 percent below 1990 levels within 10–15 years. Notably, India and China had yet to enter their economic booms, and thus were not considered industrialized nations for purposes of the protocol and are not subject to the requirements. And while 192 nations would eventually adopt the Kyoto Protocol, the United States does not, undermining the agreement.</p>
            <p><b>2001 –</b> Marrakesh Accords: Representatives from 160 nations meet to further plan out implementation of the Kyoto Protocol, including differentiations between developed nations and transitioning nations.</p>
            <p><b>2005 –</b> Kyoto Protocol goes into effect: After nearly a decade of work on its implementation, the Kyoto Protocol goes into effect. In the ensuing years, many nations – including the European Union – would meet their targets and cut emissions. That progress, however, was more than offset by countries like the US and China continuing to increase emissions.</p>
            <p><b>2009 –</b> COP 15: When world leaders gathered in Copenhagen for COP 15, there were high hopes for a legally binding treaty to build off of the Kyoto Protocol. Instead, nations were unable to agree on firm targets and left instead with just a non-binding accord. Still, the conference did produce some progress on setting targets and implementation mechanisms, as well as establishing a goal of $100 billion per year in financing for developing nations to shift towards low-carbon development and build resilience.</p>
            <p><b>2011 –</b> COP 17: Countries meeting in Durban agree to develop a “protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force” that would be “applicable to all Parties.” The agreement in Durban lays the foundation for a binding, universal agreement to come in the following years.</p>
            <p><b>2013 –</b> Warsaw Mechanism for Loss and Damage: COP 19 saw the establishment of the first formalized international mechanism for dealing with loss and damage, a term broadly understood to mean the negative consequences of the climate crisis that cannot be avoided through mitigation and adaptation. Developing and vulnerable nations have long pushed for action on loss and damage and continue to call for further action.</p>
            <p><b>2015 –</b> Paris Agreement: After years of struggling to achieve a broad agreement that could build upon the Kyoto Protocol, COP 21 delivered the Paris Agreement – the most ambitious global climate agreement the world has ever seen. The Paris Agreement set an overarching goal to keep warming “well below” 2 degrees Celsius while “pursuing efforts” to keep it under 1.5 degrees, and included each nation offering specific, challenging targets that they felt were achievable, even if they have so far been inadequate. With China, India, and the US on board at its signing, this historic accord gave the world both the framework to halt rising temperatures and the international muscle to do it. Unfortunately, there was a major setback when the Trump Administration refused to act on US commitments and then removed the country from the agreement earlier this month. But by design, the Paris Agreement offers an easy path for nations to re-enter the agreement – and President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to return the US to the accord on his first day in office.</p>
            <p><b>2019 – </b>Climate Action Summit: Set against the backdrop of youth climate strikes around the globe, UN Secretary-General António Guterres convened a special summit to focus on the need for urgent action and encourage nations to enhance their pledges to cut carbon emissions. And 70 nations stepped up, committing to cut emissions by more than their Paris pledges. But those nations represented just 6.8 percent of global emissions – and with the US, China, and India offering few concrete promises, the summit did not deliver the hoped-for breakthrough.</p>
            <p><b>2020 – </b>Postponement of COP 26: Recognizing that deeper emissions reductions would be required to meet the challenge, countries agreed at COP 21 to update or enhance their first Paris Agreement commitments by the end of 2020. But COP 26’s postponement has limited countries’ ability to pressure each other to do so. The United Kingdom hopes to encourage higher commitments on December 12, the fifth anniversary of the Paris Agreement adoption.</p>

        <h2>Individual Actions:</h2>
        <p>Simple actions like reducing energy consumption, using public transportation, and adopting sustainable diets can contribute to reducing individual carbon footprints.</p>
